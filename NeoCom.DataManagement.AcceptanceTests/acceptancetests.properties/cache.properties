#  ENVIRONMENT: Java 1.8 Library.
#  DESCRIPTION: NeoCom project library that comes from the old Models package but that includes much more
#               functionality than the model definitions for the Eve Online NeoCom application.
#               If now defines the pure java code for all the repositories, caches and managers that do
#               not have an specific Android implementation serving as a code base for generic platform
#               development. The architecture model has also changed to a better singleton/static
#               implementation that reduces dependencies and allows separate use of the modules. Still
#               there should be some initialization/configuration code to connect the new library to the
#               runtime implementation provided by the Application.
